# sortedset.js

Sorted set is a datatype which keeps a unique set of values in sorted order.
This is a skeleton code for frontend JavaScript takehome assignment which
job candidates are expected to fork and submit their solutions.

## Implentation

Clone this repository and implement a sorted set. You may use the following
built-in JavaScript array methods for your implementation:

* [`concat(a, b, c, ...)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat):
  joins two or more arrays and returns a copy of the
  joined arrays
* [`indexOf(x)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf):
  returns the index of an element `x` search from the start of
  the array or returns -1 if element cannot be found
* [`lastIndexOf(x)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/lastIndexOf):
  returns the last index of an element `x` searching from
  the end of the array or returns -1 if element cannot be found
* [`pop()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop):
  removes the last array element and returns the element
* [`push(x)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push):
  adds new element `x` to the end of the array and returns the new array length
* [`reverse()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse):
  reverses the order of elements
* [`shift()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift):
  removes and returns the first array element (as opposed to `pop()`)
* [`slice(i, j)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice):
  slices the elements between index `i` and `j` and returns as a new array
* [`sort()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort):
  sorts the array elements
* [`splice()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice):
  adds/removes elements to/from the array and returns removed elements
* [`unshift(x)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift):
  adds new element `x` to the beginning of the array and returns the new array length

You are _**not**_ allowed to use external JavaScript libraries. Do not
worry about sorting or runtime efficiency as we are trying to see if you can
take the basic JavaScript building blocks and write a solution to solve a
problem.
